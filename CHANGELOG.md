#### Important Changes From Previous Version

- Treat this version as a new library, though I will document several changes you need to take into account.
- After modifying the routing tables by using the module `utils`, you need now to flush the routing table cache by yourself:
    
      import { route } from 'iproute';

      await route.flush({
        table: RouteRoutingTables.Cache   // 'cache'
      });

- Some methods were renamed, fi, `delete` to `del`, `utils.routingTables.flush` to `utils.routingTables.clear`.
- Since now all `show` commands use the native `iproute` `-json` flag, the output interface is different that the one
  provided by `v1.0.0`.
- The native `monitor` command doesn't support the `-json` flag yet, and since all the manual stdout parsing was removed
  the library `monitor` will only give you the actual `stdout` lines for now, not a parsed object.
